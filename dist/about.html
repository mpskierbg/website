        <p>I have been practicing law for 4 and a half years. In that time I found a passion for all things technology. I started
          off teaching myself C++. There were many moments when I wanted to punch my screen, I only continued because of
          those few times when you get an AHA moment and break threw a problem. The feeling is indescribable. I then began
          teaching myself Python. I really fell in love with Python. You could seemingly do anything with that language.
          I built scripts that scanned PDFs, twitterbots, texting code, automated social media posts, and keyloggers. I really
          enjoyed it but I wanted to learn more so I moved on to JavaScript. Which is currently where I am learning. Teaching
          myself in my spare time has been difficult, but it has taught me some invaluable skills, mainly how to search google!
          <br>
          <br> I am looking for an opportunity to get my foot in the door and show what I know I am capable of.</p>
